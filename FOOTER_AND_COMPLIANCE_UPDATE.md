- Removed "Shipping Info" and "Returns" links
- Kept only "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service" under "Legal" section
- Maintained social media links and FDA disclaimer

### 2. Created Legal Pages

#### Terms of Service (/terms)

### 3. "Clinically Validated" Updates
- Changed "Clinically Validated" → "Research-Backed Ingredients" (ProductCard)
- Changed "Clinical Validation" → "Scientific Research" (Homepage)
- Changed "clinical studies" → "scientific research" (Homepage)
- Changed "15+ clinical trials" → "Research-based formulas" (Homepage)
- Changed "Clinical Evidence" → "Scientific Research" (Homepage)

## Rationale:
- "Research-Backed Ingredients" is safer - it means the individual ingredients (like Ashwagandha) have research, not necessarily our specific products
- Avoids claiming our products have been clinically tested
- Still conveys quality and scientific basis
- More defensible from FDA perspective

## Alternative Options for Product Badge:
If you want other options instead of "Research-Backed Ingredients":
- "Traditional Formula"
- "Time-Tested Herbs"
- "Premium Quality"
- "Authentic Ayurveda"
- "Pure & Natural"
